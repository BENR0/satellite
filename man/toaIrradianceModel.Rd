\title{Compute extraterrestrial solar irradiance (ESun) based on RSR}
\usage{
toaIrradianceModel(rsr, model = "MNewKur", normalize = TRUE, date)
}
\arguments{
\item{rsr}{relative spectral response function (see details for structure)}

\item{model}{tabulated solar radiation model to be used}

\item{normalize}{normalize ESun to mean earth sun distance}

\item{date}{date of the sensor overpath (YYYY-MM-DD or POSIX* object) (
only required if ESun should be corrected to the actual earth sun distance)}
}
\value{
Vector object containing ESun for each band
}
\description{
Compute mean extraterrestrial solar irradiance (ESun) using tabulated mean
solar spectral data and the band specifiv relative spectral response
functions (rsr).
}
\details{
Computation of ESun is taken from Updike and Comp (2011).

Tabulated values for mean earth sun distance are taken from the
data sources mentionend in the references.

If results should not be normalized to a mean earth sun distance, the
actual earth sun distance is approximated by the day of the year using
\code{\link{earthSun}}.

Relative spectral response values have to be supplied as a as a data frame
which has at least these a column "Wavelength" for the wavelength data in nm
(must not be rounded to full nm) and a column "RSR" for the response
information [0...1].

Tabulated solar irradiance (W m-2 nm-1) is taken from taken from the

\seealso{
\code{\link{toaIrradianceTable}} for tabulated solar irradiance
values from the literature or \code{\link{toaIrradianceRadRef}} for the
computation of the solar irradiance based on maximum radiation and reflection
values of the dataset.

See \code{\link{earthSun}} for calculating the sun-earth
distance based on the day of the year which is called by this function if
ESun should be corrected for actual earth sun distance.

See \code{\link{eSun}} which can be used as a wrapper function for the
satellite sensors already included in this package.
